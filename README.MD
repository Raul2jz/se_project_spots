# Spots - Sprint 3 Project

## HTML

Worked on Header, ul/li structures, buttons, and Cards

## CSS

Used an index.css file to put all blocks in one compartment from what I understand improves efficency.

Having the BEM flat file structure Helped with finding files you needed according to the project.

Used flex-box
Using Align-self, justify-content,align-Items in this project.

## Media query

Media screen would adjust at 627px
used new changes we made like margin 100%
flex-containers helped with moving stretching the add button.

## Figma

Gave me a detailed Instuctions including
-Margins, Images, Font sizes, Colors

## Footer

Kevin left this for us, so I used a few details from our last sprint aswell as padding to align it correctly.

## Mistakes I learned From

Downloaded a jpeg instead of an svg File
could not Change background color.

Went down a huge rabbit hole Moving margins padding and really everything around trying to use a jpg file.
